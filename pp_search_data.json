Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.8.2 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.8 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.8 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows ,  MacOS  and  Ubuntu . For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on Windows /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on MacOS /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on Ubuntu Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort().reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"introduction/","title":"Introduction","tags":["welcome"],"text":"main a img {\n    width: 5rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n}\n Seismology: Unveiling Earth’s Vibrations Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and the vibrations they generate within the Earth. By analyzing these seismic waves, seismologists can gain valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of our planet. Through the use of specialized instruments called seismometers, seismologists measure and record the ground motion caused by earthquakes. These recordings, known as seismograms, provide crucial data that can be used to understand the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through different layers of the Earth. Seismology plays a vital role in various fields, including earthquake engineering, hazard assessment, and the exploration of natural resources. By studying seismic activity, scientists can assess the potential risks associated with earthquakes, develop strategies for building resilient structures, and even locate underground oil and gas reservoirs. In this course, we will delve into the fascinating world of seismology, exploring the principles and techniques used to analyze seismic data. By the end of this journey, you will have a solid foundation in seismology and be equipped with the tools to interpret seismic waves and unravel the secrets hidden beneath our feet. Let’s embark on this seismic adventure and discover the captivating realm of seismology together."},{"url":"logistics/","title":"Course Logistics","tags":["welcome"],"text":"main a img {\n    width: 5rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n}\n Grading Assignments (40%); Mid term presentations (30%); End term exam (30%) Late assignments will receive no credit, please submit Mid/End Term Exams Open book exams, where you will have access to textbook chapters/ other reading material.

The core function, `model string`, initializes the simulation environment and defines two parallel functions `compute vy ` and `compute σ `, which update the velocity and stress fields, respectively. The simulation parameters include the shear modulus `μ0` , density `ρ0` , spatial grid `xgrid` , and temporal grid tgrid . The notebook sets up the numerical grid, allocates arrays for stress `σ` and velocity `vy` , and initializes the velocity field with a Gaussian distribution. The medium's properties are heterogeneous, with boundary marked by the red line.
