A [collection](https://pawbz.github.io/Interactive-Seismology.jl/) of *reactive notebooks* using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) notebook system, Pluto. These notebooks are designed to illustrate fundamental concepts in seismology in an interactive manner. They are primarily intended to support our courses on Seismology (ES218) and Inverse Problems (ES219), and are accessible to students with minimal programming experience. The notebooks contain all the essential mathematical expressions, which are easily manipulated using [Symbolics.jl](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/dev/), a modern Computer Algebra System (CAS). By using these standalone notebooks, students can intuitively explore and gain a better understanding of wave phenomena in seismology.
Sample notebooks are available via the index page after starting Pluto.

#              Thanks to Pluto.jl, the website is built using real code, and instead of a book, we have a series of interactive notebooks.
#              **On the website, students can play with sliders, buttons and images to interact with our simulations.**
#              You can even go further, and modify and run any code on our website!
