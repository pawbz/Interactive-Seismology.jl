    This template will allow you to build a website like the **Computational thinking with Julia** class tought at MIT.
    Use it to harness the power of Julia and Pluto in your own teaching and enhance students learning experience.

             Thanks to Pluto.jl, the website is built using real code, and instead of a book, we have a series of interactive notebooks.
             **On the website, students can play with sliders, buttons and images to interact with our simulations.**
             You can even go further, and modify and run any code on our website!

             In literature it's not enough to just know the technicalities of grammar.
             In music it's not enough to learn the scales. The goal is to communicate experiences and emotions.
             For a computer scientist, it's not enough to write a working program,
             the program should be written with beautiful high level abstractions that speak to your audience.
             **Julia is designed with this purpose in mind, use it in your teaching to harness its power.**
