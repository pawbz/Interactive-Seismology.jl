Earth, in all its grand complexity, whispers its secrets through an orchestra of data. In this course, we'll become skilled detectives, equipped with powerful analytical tools to decode these whispers and unlock the mysteries of our planet.

Let's imagine Earth as a puzzle box, with three chambers holding the keys to understanding its dynamic processes. The first chamber houses the measured quantities, fingerprints of its current state. The second holds the governing laws, the hidden rules that orchestrate its dance. And finally, in the third chamber lie the hidden parameters, unseen yet crucial players in this grand story.

This course equips you with the skills to tackle various challenges, depending on what's known and what needs to be revealed. We'll dive into:

* **Inverse Problems**: When the rules are known but the players hiding in the shadows remain unseen. Like a detective reconstructing a crime scene, we'll use data and laws to unmask these hidden parameters.
* **Learning Problems**: When the rules themselves are shrouded in mystery. We'll become data-driven alchemists, transforming information into a map of the underlying laws that govern Earth's behavior.
* **Design Problems**: Before the experiment even begins, we'll become master strategists, designing data acquisition to optimally reveal the hidden secrets we seek.

Throughout this journey, we'll explore a diverse range of Earth science applications, from predicting climate change to understanding earthquakes. You'll not only gain technical skills in data analysis but also forge a deeper connection with our planet, appreciating its interconnectedness and learning to ask the right questions to unlock its secrets.
