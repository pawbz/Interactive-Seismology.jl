# Example Polynomial Model Input File for AXISEM 2.0
NAME                homo-full-sphere

# is this model defined by multiple layers [layer] or polynomials [poly]
MODEL_TYPE          poly

# number of regions in which the model is described by polynomials
NREGIONS            1

# radii of discontinuties, for whole planets starts from the center (0.0) and includes
# the free surface. This should hence be NREGIONS + 1 floats
DISCONTINUITIES     6371000.0 0.

# index of the Moho discontinuity from the top (0 = surface)
MOHO_IDX            0

# index of the discontinuity where Moho topography is compenstated from the top (0 = surface)
MOHO_COMP_IDX       0

# maximum polynomial degree throughout the whole model, default: 3
MAX_POLY_DEG        0

# prefactor to scale the radius before evaluating the polynomial, default:
# radius of the planet
SCALE               6371000.0

# Are the units given in meters and meters per second?
# Allowed values:
#    m - lengths in m,  velocities in m/s,  density in kg/m^3
#   km - lengths in km, velocities in km/s, density in g/cm^3 
UNITS               m

# Indentations by at least two blanks are necessary.
# Assuming to have same order as DISCONTINUITIES (from center to the surface or vice versa)
