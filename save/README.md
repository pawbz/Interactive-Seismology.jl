# Interactive Seismology Notebooks

A [collection](https://pawbz.github.io/Interactive-Seismology.jl/) of *reactive notebooks* using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) notebook system, Pluto. These notebooks are designed to illustrate fundamental concepts in seismology in an interactive manner. They are primarily intended to support our courses on Seismology (ES218) and Inverse Problems (ES219), and are accessible to students with minimal programming experience. The notebooks contain all the essential mathematical expressions, which are easily manipulated using [Symbolics.jl](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/dev/), a modern Computer Algebra System (CAS). By using these standalone notebooks, students can intuitively explore and gain a better understanding of wave phenomena in seismology.
